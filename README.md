## Projects

### Fake News Detection [Link](https://github.com/Oyeniran20/Fake-News-Detection/blob/main/Fake_News.ipynb)

Developed a machine learning-based system for detecting fake news articles. The project utilized natural language processing (NLP) techniques such as text preprocessing, vectorization, and feature extraction to analyze articles. Various classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boost, were tested to determine their effectiveness in distinguishing between real and fake news.

The model achieved high accuracy in identifying fake news, demonstrating the potential of machine learning in mitigating the spread of misinformation in digital media.

### Customer Profiling and Segmentation [Link](https://github.com/Oyeniran20/Customer-Segmentation/blob/main/Customer_Segmentation.ipynb)

Designed and implemented a customer profiling and segmentation system using K-Means clustering to identify distinct customer segments. The project focused on understanding customer behavior and preferences to enhance targeted marketing strategies and improve business decision-making.

1. **K-Means Clustering:** Partitioned customers based on spending patterns and demographics.
2. **Mini-Batch K-Means:** Improved computational efficiency for large-scale datasets.
3. **K-Means++ Initialization:** Enhanced cluster quality through optimized centroid selection.
4. **Hierarchical Clustering:** Provided a tree-like visualization of customer clusters, enabling intuitive insights into nested relationships.
5. **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Identified outlier customers and formed clusters based on density, capturing non-linear cluster shapes.
